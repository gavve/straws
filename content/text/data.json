    'text': 'We all love sipping on a juice or smoothie or might pop a straw into a water bottle like it's no big deal, but the humble plastic straw is one of the worst culprits in environmental damage. We use hundreds of millions of plastic straws every day, and most of them end up in landfills and our oceans, polluting the water and killing marine life. If nothing changes, there will be more waste plastic in the sea than fish by 2050.

    Bamboo straws make a great eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic straws since they can be washed and reused over and over again, and are fully recyclable once they've been used for years. Made from 100% Bamboo, these earth-friendly straws are both cost-effective and beautiful. To clean, simply rinse them out under the tap after everyday use or shake in a jar of warm soapy water if you like. Every month or so, you can boil a pot of vinegar water mix and soak the straws for a few minutes if you want a super thorough clean.
    
    Thanks for saving the earth a little bit.'
