                    <h1>The Straw</h1>
                    <p>
                      We all love sipping on a juice or smoothie or might pop a straw into a water bottle like it's no big deal, 
                      but the humble plastic straw is one of the worst culprits in environmental damage. We use hundreds of millions of 
                      plastic straws every day, and most of them end up in landfills and our oceans, polluting the water and killing marine life.

                      <h1>The Change</h1>
                      <p>
                          If nothing changes, there will be more waste plastic in the sea than fish by 2050. Bamboo straws make a great eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic straws since they can be washed and reused over and over again, and are fully recyclable once they've been used for years. Made from 100% Bamboo, these earth-friendly straws are both cost-effective and beautiful.

                      <p>
                          To clean, simply rinse them out under the tap after everyday use or shake in a jar of warm soapy water if you like. Every month or so, you can boil a pot of vinegar water mix and soak the straws for a few minutes if you want a super thorough clean.

                      <p>
                          We all know that climate change, global warming, depletion of ozone layer and resource depletion are real and their impact on human and animal lives can be devastating. Simple measures like using public transportation more often, reducing energy consumption, becoming more eco-friendly can go a long way in reducing your environmental impact and making this planet a better place.

                            We believe the type of lifestyle we choose is important for our overall quality of life. For those of us who didn't grow up in a home focused on making health and earth-conscious decisions, the transition to choosing safer products and less consumptive habits can feel like it comes at the cost of great sacrifice. It may seem as though the sacrifices are both convenience, effectiveness, and cost. The good news is that making green lifestyle changes can be as simple as you'd like it to be. Start with easy swaps and, when you're ready, move on to bigger things.                         </p>

                            Our goal is simply to make this world a little better. We are a young company without many of the resources that big corporations have, so we’re starting small with ONE product. Over time, we will expand our store and eventually provide you with all the things you need to go fully green.                       </div>
